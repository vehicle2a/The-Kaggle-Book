# Introducing Kaggle and Other Data Science Competitions

The chapter discusses how competitive programming evolved into data science competitions. It explains why the Kaggle platform is the most popular site for these competitions and provides you with an idea about how it works.

Given that there is no golden approach that works for all the problems in data science, many problems require a time-consuming approach that can be summbed up as *try all that you can try*.

**No free lunch theorem**
- David Wolpert & William Macready
- Each machine learning algorithm performs if and only if its hypothesis space comprises the solution.
- As you cannot know beforehand if a machine learning algorithmc an best tackle your problem, you have to try it, testing it directly on your prbolem before being assured that you are doing the right thing.
- There are no theoretical shortcuts or other holy grails of machine learning - only empirical experimentation can tell you what works.

## Getting Started##
- For complete beginners: **Getting Started** or **Playground** competitons.
- **Featured** and **Research** competitions are about fringe applications, and need a solid background or a willigness to study.
